# JS-basics

<b>Diary of a junior dev on furlough</b>

Hello, my name is Mel. I'm currently living in lockdown under laws enforced by the UK government. To keep my life as normal as possible. I'm upskilling in JS. By the end of this lock down. I aim to have improved my understanding of the language, and built my first thing (not sure what its going to be yet) using a fancy JS framework. 

If anyone wants to contribute or work on a project with me. Contact me on twitter @mel_codes Stay safe, and <b>please do not go outside.</b>
