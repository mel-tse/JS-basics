<b>Diary of a junior dev on furlough</b>

Hello, my name is Mel. I'm currently living in lockdown under laws enforced by the UK government. To keep my life as normal as possible. I am upskilling in JS. By the end of this lock down, I aim to have improved my understanding of the language. 

If anyone wants to contribute or work on a project with me. Contact me on twitter @mel_codes
